# PyBot
# Description
This repository contains an Android Application that connects to a Raspberry Pi robot. 
This application goes along with a bigger gesture recognition system. The system involves a Raspberry Pi that has a SenseHAT connected to it. With the SenseHAT, we use the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to create gestures, label them, train them, and test them with machine learning. Each gesture is assigned a number value, and when a gesture is recognized, the number value is outputted. This output is sent to a cloud server. Through the cloud server, the app will retrieve the output and send that output to the robot via bluetooth. The robot will perform a related action based on the gesture it received. The app also utilizes voice control as well in a similar fashion.
# Installation
To install this repository, use the green tab to clone or download the zip file. As this app is dependent on a cloud server and a Raspberry Pi robot, the code will not work as expected without those materials.
